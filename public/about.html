<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Suzanne Gaskill.  My preferred name is Sue.  I am married and have one son. I am currently a stay at home mom whose son has left the nest.</p>

<p>I have a bachelors degree in elementary education and a masters in Educational Technology.  I taught kindergarten for five years then taught elementary technology for seven.  I decided at that point to stay home to care for my family.  </p>

<p>My son recently left for college leaving me in a big house all by myself.  I found I had a lot of time on my hands and decided to re-enter the work force but in a different arena.  I decided to take some classes in web development so I begin a new career and a new adventure.</p>
<p>My dream career would be to use my new skills to develop new projects for a government funded company.  I would love to work on something that would benefit veterans.  As a veteran myself I would welcome the opportunity to help those reentering civilian life.</p>
<p>I know I do not look like the typical new developer fresh out of college, but I feel my previous skills allow me to see things in a whole different light.  I love keeping up on new technology and learning new skills.  I am very well organized and respectful of time.  I have worked well with a variety of people with all types of personalities.</p>
<p>Please feel free to contact me with any further questions.</p>
